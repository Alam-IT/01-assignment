Yesterday's session : pom.xml file and maven project structure

Today's session : Maven Repositories
-------------------------------------------------





-> Maven is maintaing below 3 types of Repository

	1) Central Repository

	2) Local Repository

	3) Remote Repository

-> When we add dependency in pom.xml file, maven will download that dependency from Central Repository which is maintaining by Apache.

-> First time only it will download from Central Repository and it will keep in Local Repository

-> Local Repository will be created in our System.

Note: In Windows 10, Local repository will be available in below location

	C:\\Users\username\.m2\repository

Can we change Maven Local Repository Location?
----------------------------------------------
Yes, we can do that.

Procedure to change Maven Local Repo location
----------------------------------------------
-> Go to Maven_Home Folder
-> Navigate to conf folder
-> Open settings.xml file
-> Change Local repo location


Syntax
------
  <localRepository>E://Local-Repo</localRepository>

What is Remote Repository?
--------------------------
In Reatlime, companies will maintain their own repository that is called as Remote repository.

-> Remote repository details will be configured in settings.xml file

-> If we want to connect to remore repository, we should add settings.xml file in IDE.

How to use remote Repository
------------------------------
Eclipse Menu -> Window -> Preferences -> Maven --> User Settings -> Add user settings --> import settings.xml file which contains remote repository location.

Maven Goals
-----------
-> Maven provided several goals to perform build proess. 

-> When we execute maven goal, it executes    corresponding plugin to perform build action

clean : Delete target folder

compile : compile source code

test :  Execute JUnits

package : create jar or war based on packaging type

install : To install our project into local repo as a dependency to use in other projects
